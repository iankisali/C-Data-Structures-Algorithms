# What is data structure?

**Data structures**, as the term implies, are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use, and create data, depending on the task at hand. We will learn over time to select and properly use data structures which fit the nature of the data you are working with.

The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure.

## Classification of data structures
Data structures are broadly classified into two:
- **Linear data stucture**. Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements. 
- **Non-linear data strucures**. Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly.

- **Static data structure:**  has a fixed memory size. The content of the data structure can be modified but without changing the memory space allocated to it. Example is an array that holds a fixed number of values of one data type.
- **Dynamic data structure:**  is that kind of data structure that changes its size during runtime. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, linked list etc
