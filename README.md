## Data structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains notes and projects in DSA as implemented in C.

It will cover the key ideas involved in design *algorithm* , how they depend on design of suitable *data structure*, and how some structures are more efficient than others for the same task.


I have used Visual Studio Code IDE in my projects. Install the following to setup your code editor to configure C and C++ compiler and debuger :
- VS Code IDE setup [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- C/C++ Extension for VS Code [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- Mingw-w64 [here](https://www.msys2.org/)
